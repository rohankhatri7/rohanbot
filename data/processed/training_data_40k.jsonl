{"instruction": "update:In his poem \u201cDothead,\u201d Amit Majmudar conveys that the bindi in Hindu culture has more significance than appearing as a pointless red dot through the strategic use of both simile and allusion. In the beginning of the poem, Majumudar utilizes simile to explain the meaning behind the bindi and why people in his culture wear it. After being constantly asked if his mom wears the bindi, the speaker thinks to himself about how the bindi can be compared to \u201cthe X that says where treasure\u2019s at / is not the treasure, but as good as treasure\u201d (9-10). Using simile makes it apparent that the bindi has more meaning to the people of the Hindu culture and that they see it as a marking for something that is as valuable as treasure. To them, the bindi marks the love a woman has for her husband similar to how a red \u201cx\u201d marks treasure. By wearing the bindi, female Hindus are showing the world that on the inside, they value love and family more so than material items such as gems or metals.", "input": "", "output": "not specific bones"}

{"instruction": "3. What would you say is your greatest talent or skill? How have you developed and demonstrated that talent over time? My greatest talent is my perseverance when it comes to music. Starting with the recorder and progressing my way through multiple instruments, I finally found my calling with the drums. I was by no means a prodigy since I looked like a little kid with a brand-new toy, banging away as loudly as I could when first touching the instrument. 4 years later and I am proud to call myself the center snare drum of my school\u2019s band program. The hours of practicing my paradiddles and rudiments to a metronome in my room have yielded results. As I line up with my fellow band members, I begin the tap-off, commencing the march. While I play the pieces in the annual Veterans Day Parade for the city of Elk Grove, the notes are no longer meaningless noises, but I sense every beat I play. Realizing I need to play faster at a mezzo piano noise level, I feel my grip tighten; and as each measure passes, I notice my feet marching perfectly in time. With my wrists about to give out, I realize we reached the end, so I signal the band to stop by initiating the drum break. Despite reveling in my love for the drums, I learned how to read music through the guitar and piano. I spent countless hours on Youtube trying to mimic people\u2019s fingerings to play songs, and when my fingers were in agony from pressing down on the metal strings, I never stopped. During recital performances, I would apply bandages over my fingertips to numb the pain from my calluses peeling after practicing the songs for so long to attempt to create the pleasant sounds my family was accustomed to hearing echo from my room.", "input": "", "output": "mhmmmm"}

{"instruction": "Structural unemployment: Unemployment that occurs due to a mismatch between the skills of job seekers and the available job openings. Example: A coal miner who loses their job due to the decline in the coal industry and lacks the skills required for available job openings in other fields would be considered structurally unemployed. Cyclical unemployment: Unemployment that occurs due to fluctuations in the business cycle. For example, during a recession, many workers may be laid off. Example: During the COVID-19 pandemic, many businesses were forced to lay off workers due to the economic downturn, resulting in an increase in cyclical unemployment. Underemployed: Workers who are employed but are not working to their full potential or are working in jobs that do not fully utilize their skills. Example: A college-educated worker who is currently working as a cashier in a retail store would be considered underemployed. Discouraged workers: Individuals who have given up looking for work due to a lack of job opportunities. Example: An individual who has been unemployed for an extended period of time and has stopped looking for work would be considered a discouraged worker. Inflation: The rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is increasing over time. Example: In 2022, the inflation rate in the United States was 6.2%, meaning that the general level of prices for goods and services increased by 6.2% compared to the previous year. Purchasing power: The value of money in terms of the amount of goods and services that it can buy. Example: If the inflation rate is 2% and your income remains the same, your purchasing power would decrease by 2% because the same amount of money can buy fewer goods and services due to inflation.", "input": "", "output": "bro im genuinely pissed i cant enroll in the 157c when im literally taking 157a rn"}

We did not have to beg for anything. Our Creator had taught us how to find and make everything we needed, from trees and plants and animals and stone. We lived in bark, and we wore only the skins of animals. Thus were we created. Thus we lived for a long time, proud and happy. We had never eaten pig meat, nor tasted the poison called whiskey, nor worn wool from sheep, nor struck fire or dug earth with steel, nor cooked in iron, nor hunted and fought with loud guns, nor ever had diseases which soured our blood or rotted our organs. We were pure, so we were strong and happy. For many years we traded furs to the English or the French, for wool blankets and guns and iron things, for steel awls and needles and axes, for mirrors, for pretty things made of beads and silver. And for liquor. This was foolish, but we did not know it. We shut our ears to the Great Good Spirit. We did not want to hear that we were being foolish. If we hunt in the old ways, we will not have to depend on the white men, for new guns and powder and lead, or go to them to have broken guns repaired. Remember it is the wish of the Great Good Spirit that we have no more commerce with the white man! This is the one stimulus 4 pt. question.

{"instruction": "and idk it", "input": "", "output": "The structure of a typical Greek tragedy is still seen in modern storytelling through the use of props, theatrical components, and the ways the emotions and messages of stories are expressed. One of the most apparent influential factors from Greek theater seen today is the use of props, such as masks. In ancient Greek theater, such as the theater of Dionysus, masks were a central part of the plays performed as they helped enhance the story or plotline of the plays (Brown University). Even to this day, masks are often used in cinematic pieces, such as the iconic Darth Vader mask or even the masks used in horror films. These masks, both used in the past and present, have been shown to elevate the stories being expressed and the characters being presented. Another influential component from Greek theater used today is the use of music. In Greek theater, orchestras were typically used for dramatic scenes in tragedies (Haldon). While not all narrative arts contain live orchestras today, musical components can still be found in modern day works, as seen with the usage of soundtracks in movies and television shows. Similar to how it was used in the past, music is used to exemplify the feelings and emotions of a particular scene or moment in the storyline. Lastly, the structure of Greek tragedy has influenced the modern structure of storytelling as well. Two major components of Greek theater include episodes, which are the dialogue pieces of a drama, and stasimons, which are the musical pieces of a drama. The combination of both dialogue and musical pieces in storytelling is still very much alive as seen with the presence of musical theater. Overall, Greek theater and tragic structure have been shown to be heavily influential to modern storytelling as shown through the similarities in props and the structure of how the stories are developed."}

{"instruction": "Bradbury's purpose of using a dystopian setting in Fahrenheit 451 is to achieve the goals that a dystopian fiction should such as criticizing a trend or societal norm. In the novel, Bradbury chooses a dystopian setting to criticize many topics such as the dangers of technology, censorship, and the severe difference between knowledge and ignorance. In the novel Bradbury illustrates the dystopian setting through dialogue of a character known as Captain Beatty who states, \u201c\u2018Colored people don't like Little Black Sambo. Burn it. White people don't feel good about Uncle Tom's Cabin. Burn it\u201d (Bradbury 57). The dystopian feature here is that firemen in this society burn books and houses rather than put fires out. By exaggerating this concept, Bradbury is able to criticize political systems that censor in the real world that control access to books, films, and news.", "input": "", "output": "for wednesday performance"}

{"instruction": "The strength of intermolecular forces between polar bonded forces is greater than the strength of the intermolecular forces between nonpolar bonded molecules. An example of this can be seen in the SIM when it was harder to pull the two HBr apart compared to the two H2 apart. This can be explained due to the fact that polar covalent bonds produce partial charges whereas nonpolar covalent bonds do not produce any charges. According to Coulomb\u2019s Law, the partial charges will increase the force of attraction between molecules, resulting in polar bonded forces to have a stronger/greater intermolecular force.", "input": "", "output": "bet gracias"}

{"instruction": "First and foremost, Gladwell\u2019s claim that a component to becoming successful depends on one\u2019s circumstances remains prevalent in the modern era. In today\u2019s society, people fail to attribute others\u2019 success to their circumstances that got them there in the first place, such as one\u2019s family background. One prime instance of this can be seen by Mark Zuckerberg who is Co-founder, CEO, and Chair of the billion dollar company Facebook. Growing up in New York and being raised in a wealthy and well-educated family, Zuckerberg had access to opportunities kids his age at the time did not have. For example, he did not come from a poor family, meaning he had a childhood where he could focus on his education with access to a computer which, according to his father, \u201c[Had] advantages to being exposed to computers early on. That certainly enriched Mark\u2019s interest in technology.\u201d This ultimately resulted in him dropping out of Harvard University to pursue growing his company. If his family was never wealthy, Zuckerberg never would have been able to drop out of college and Facebook would be nowhere near as successful as it is today as it would likely not even be a company. Zuckerberg being born into a rich family was purely luck and that allowed him to develop a passion to follow a career in computer science. Had he been born into a less financially-stable family, he never would have had the opportunity to grow an interest in computers. Zuckerberg was able to take advantage of this circumstance that was thrust upon him and progress it into a successful business.", "input": "", "output": "we can say the separated O2 collects in the product tank"}

In a goat for example when dealing with posterior and dorsal, the posterior is towards the back of them, meaning it is behind their tails. However, the dorsal side would be above the goat (vertically) as their vertebra is horizontal (parallel) to the ground. Contrastingly in humans, since they stand vertically and their vertebra is vertical (perpendicular) to the ground, both the posterior and dorsal side is towards the back of the human as it is towards the vertebra and back."}

{"instruction": "I would politely explain to my friend that anterior and posterior cannot be used interchangeably with ventral and dorsal as the terms are applied differently to 4-legged animals whereas humans walk on 2 legs. In a goat for example when dealing with posterior and dorsal, the posterior is towards the back of them, meaning it is behind their tails. However, the dorsal side would be above the goat (vertically) as their vertebra is horizontal (parallel) to the ground. Contrastingly in humans, since they stand vertically and their vertebra is vertical (perpendicular) to the ground, both the posterior and dorsal side is towards the back of the human as it is towards the vertebra and back. The same difference can be seen in anterior and ventral terms. In a goat, the anterior side would be towards the front in front of their head, but the anterior side would be below them as their chest is under their body and horizontal to the ground. Compared to humans, the anterior and ventral side share the same side as humans stand vertically with their chests perpendicular to the ground. Therefore, these terms cannot always be used interchangeably.", "input": "", "output": "how was the quiz"}

{"instruction": "dating back to the early days of the month of september, jon wehner decided to change lab groups and seats on the 22nd of this month, where the lives of kaithlyn ly and rohan khatri would change forever. Here, they would become lab partners in a lab group that also had cyrus velasco and maddy lee, but mainly just rohan kaithlyn and maddy since cyrus provided no value whatsoever. Continuing, cyrus would ask for kaithlyns name and get absolutely fucking clowned to where kaithlyn would think rohan gay. As the group conducted more labs and talked, their friendships grew. Particularly, the friendship between rohan and kaithlyn was strong to the point where every single fucking person to have ever attended PGHS thinks rohan fucking likes her and hes sick of getting bullied for it day in and day out. Moreover, on the weekend that contained November 6, Kaithlyn would introduce danny to rohan and cyrus stating the 47th boi that she thought was cute. After eating all her chocolate on november 8th, she would join an audio call with dear rohan and cyrus where they would talk abt how down bad cyrus and kaithlyn were. Later in that day, kaithlyn would ask them if she should ft mr danny himself. When trying to offer friendly advice, rohan has his message absolutely slandered and manipulated by dear friend kaithlyn where she tries to portray him as a bully to the public but he meant no ill intent. As can be seen in his message of \"put on makeup\" he wanted his friend to look her best possible self because even w/o makeup, she could still pull danny, but with makeup, she would be showing her true beauty and make danny simp for her. However, kaithlyn was still 1head and did not accept the intent of the message. Rohan than proceeds to become depressed and dresses like Evan.", "input": "", "output": "nope"}

{"instruction": "8. I awake to a mixture of aromas in the air. I smell the rich, flavorful spices of Indian food, but I also sense bitterness and stench of raw, uncooked meat. It is then that I realize that both my parents are cooking foods of their culture that could not be more different from one another. As a child of mixed background, I can empathize with others to create a friendly and efficient working environment. I am active in both cultures, which I hold a lot of pride in. Whether it be helping cook and serve food for over hundreds of people during Indian festivals or aiding in carnival games during the annual Vietnamese Moon festival , participating in both sides lets me connect with different people of opposite communities. Catching up with adults that I have not seen in a while and seeing little kids running around fills me with joy. Yet, I have witnessed the occasional stares when at these events since I do not necessarily fit in with the crowd. Nevertheless, I have been able to develop the ability of incorporating others so that no one is left out. In group projects, I make it a priority to get to know everyone and what they are like. In doing so, it helps to understand how people think to build the most productive and translucent work environment. Rather than assigning everyone individual parts that they must complete in a certain time frame, I make it known that everyone is free add to any part they wish, allowing them to play to their strengths. Overall, this builds team coordination and leaves everyone pleased with the group score that we earn. Being part of my communities has taught me valuable lessons that I apply daily. University of California has a reputation for having lively and unique communities. By assisting in enhancing the school\u2019s communities, both I and the school will grow together.", "input": "", "output": "OHHHH"}

{"instruction": "The algorithm in layoutContainer() first gets the components from the container. Then, it gets the inset of the container and calculates xcenter by adding the max left component to the left inset. The y vertical position is based on the top inset. The for loop iterates through the components in pairs since +=2 to get the right and left components. The preferred dimensions are retrieved and height is set to the max height of the 2. The left component has its size and position set, and the right component has it size and position set with respect to the specified gap which ends by adjusting the height. Q2. The Strategy Pattern defines algorithms that are encapsulated to allow them to be interchangeable and be independent of another. At runtime, different algorithms can be chosen without the changing the objects that use them. This allows code to be reused as the behavior of said object can be changed according to what strategy the user wants to use. When it comes to implementing the LayoutManager, different layouts can be implemented like JFrame or JPanel by the container according to the user's needs and what they want in the container. Each implementation allows for components in the container to be arranged differently. BorderLayout can implement the LayoutManager interface differently then how FormLayout would implement the same interface.", "input": "", "output": "it is tbh but i dont rly wanna roast him cuz hes my friend"}

{"instruction": "The two types of basic analysis for reading literacy are observing, identifying patterns, and drawing conclusions. The second type is using one\u2019s memory, identifying symbols, and looking for patterns. Before even reading the article by Nicholas Carr, I first looked at the questions we would have to answer in the end so that I would know what to look for when reading. The basic analysis steps I did to analyze \u201cShallows\u201d was to observe, identify, and draw a conclusion. I first read the article, and paid close attention to detail to make observations. After reading it the first time and making a list of my observations, I scanned it once more to find any patterns or similarities. Using the patterns and observations I made, I was able to come to the conclusion about how Carr felt about the topic (the effects of the Internet). The easiest steps were making observations and drawing conclusions because they go hand in hand as observations are easy to make when reading the text. By making those detailed observations, it became easier to draw a conclusion. The most challenging step was identifying the patterns as this was the step I took the most time on and it is not clearly stated. Finding the patterns was hard as it required me to have a deeper understanding of the text, but once I did, it was easy to complete all the other steps.", "input": "", "output": "uwu"}

{"instruction": ".skip", "input": "", "output": "Moreover, possessing a strong work ethic along with having an innate talent is pivotal to success according to Gladwell\u2019s thesis. His argument states that 10,000 hours is the magical number of time a person needs to nurture their innate talent to succeed at a high level. Tyler Blevins, better known as Ninja online, applies to this theory as he has grown to become one of the most successful gamers: he has a net worth of 25 million dollars, played with celebrities such as Drake or Travis Scott, and has promoted the relevance of the gaming industry globally. As a child, his older brothers reported that he was already better than them at video games despite being a younger age. Beginning his professional career in 2009, Ninja would play Halo 3 for multiple organizations until 2011 when he would first start streaming. For the past ten years, Ninja has streamed eight to twelve hours a day, five to six days a week playing a variety of video games rather it be professional or recreational. Calculating the amount of time he has put into keeping his audience entertained, Ninja has well surpassed the threshold of 10,000 hours. He displays how he not only had top-tier skill for a gamer, but has committed an enormous amount of time to becoming one of the best in his profession. Had he put in any less time or doubted himself along the way, he would not be anywhere close to as successful as he is today."}

{"instruction": "hell tell u the frq", "input": "", "output": "At the beginning of the novel, Bradbury utilizes personification to demonstrate how extreme usage of technology leads to empty relationships between humans. In part one called \u201cThe Hearth and the Salamander,\u201d Montag returns home to find his wife Mildred overdosed on the floor, when he suddenly hears \u201cthe sky over the house scream\u201d where \u201cThere was a tremendous ripping sound\u201d (Bradbury 11). By using personification, it is clear that the bomber jets in the sky make their presence known, but society does not pay attention to them as they are caught up with technology in their false realities. Society is consumed with the distraction technology presents, that they do not discuss with friends or family the events that occur around them, as many are ignorant to the fact that there is a war occurring around them. Technology allows an escape from real world problems that prevents the development of socialization skills between humans and therefore, any chance of having meaningful conversations with each other. By employing personification, Bradbury illustrates how excessive use of technology is dangerous as it leads to empty relationships and meaningless conversations between humans."}

Getting to work with people that could not be more different from another under our love for music fills me with pride. It does not matter if I am competing against other bands, playing at sporting events, or marching in parades, I am always learning new lessons. I intervene when the two percussionists always argue about who is playing the correct rudiments. They teach me to be open-minded to criticism. I watch the drum major continue to march on after dropping his mace during his routine. He shows me to carry on through one\u2019s obstacles as success is still achievable regardless of mistakes. I congratulate the freshmen who scream at the top of their lungs after marching the field show. They motivate me to try new things. I never hesitate to help people who are new to playing music or work with people far better than me. I aspire to never stop learning, both in and outside of the band."}

During Covid, we made a server with 5-6 friends where we all go and hang out everyday because it is the only way we can socialize. Me and my friends have lately been making fun of Aaron for being a simp, because of how he treats girls so much better than us. And today, I went too far and I changed my discord status to what you saw. I honestly wanted to let you know that I have never had any connection to you, I haven't met you personally or even believe I have seen you before\u2026 and to be honest, I never knew Aaron actually had a current girlfriend. I didn't mean what I said, as I have never even been near you in my life, and what I said was a \u201cjoke\u201d to me and the friends in that discord. Aaron ended up telling me to change it, and I did, but an hour later he told me what happened. I am truly sorry that I upset you, as I can totally understand why you would be.. And I wanted to let you know that it was a terrible mistake for a poor \u201cjoke\u201d between our friends as it got out and for the short time I had that status, you saw it\u2026. I again, by no means meant what I said.. As I have never even met you in my life, and never knew Aaron even had a girlfriend. So\u2026 I am truly sorry, I have never had to apologize like this before, so I hope it came across as forgiving, And I hope that you can please forgive me, so that Aaron would still consider me a friend.", "input": "", "output": "cuz he has hs tomorrow"}

Adichie utilizes anecdotes as a colored woman to illustrate the expectations of her while growing up and how she felt the need to impress people. By discussing how she was \u201csupposed to become a doctor\u201d and emphasizing that women should not have to \u201cmake themselves likable,\u201d Adichie achieves her purpose of persuading women to step outside the stereotypical boundaries that bound them in order to influence them to be true to themselves. Adichie addresses young women entering the \u201creal world\u201d to offer advice on how to positively impact the world even when faced with discrimination."}

{"instruction": "The Comparator.comparing(c -> c.getArea()) creates a comparator based on the values wanting to be compared from the objects. In this case, the value being compared is the area between the circles. So, the comparing method takes the area from each circle and creates a Comparator that compares the objects\u2019 areas. In this case, the Comparator interface does not have to be implemented manually. In my test program, the sort method uses the comparator to sort the circles in ascending order based on their respective areas. The thenComparing method allows you to make multiple comparisons in case the objects being compared are equivalent based on the first parameter. For instance, if the circles have equal area, the thenComparing method lets you make another comparison such as radius. That is what I did in my test program where the circles are first compared on theri areas and if two circles have the same area, they will then be compared and sorted by their radius. Comparator.comparing is a static method because it creates a new Comparator instance and does not need an existing object or comparator instance to be called on. Comparator.thenComparing is a default method because it adds onto already existing comparators to add the additional comparison parameter in case there is a tie, changing its original function..", "input": "", "output": "yk me"}

{"instruction": "Marshall - seems pretty chill, I didn't get too much information about this except the GE's are very social justice and diversity of culture in America. GE's are apparently easy to blow through and the living situation seems decent. Dining is a bit meh but its fairly close to ERC's dining hall which is much better so it evens out. Seventh - this is a bit of a gamble because seventh is a new college as of 2020. So there are only a few testimonies but from what I've seen the dining spaces seem to be great- very spacious, there are fewer people in general in seventh (I think because it's new) so you get more space per person (Don't quote me on that). GE's are also a bit confusing for me, but basically AP and IB HL courses can waive credits so that's good enough for me lol. Eleanor Roosevelt College (ERC) - This one apparently is decent, but what turned me off from it is a 1.5-year foreign language general requirement. Overall I don't have much to say on this one but between this Marshall and Warren apparently, they are all similar level, it just depends on the fit. Dining hall and food is pretty good here though. I think the location is a bit isolated from other colleges as well. Revelle - No one likes revelle. Unless you're premend- maybe do some more research because it seems to be quite premend heavy so this may be higher up on your list. But for everyone else, the GEs are quite rigorous, and overall, regarded to be the worst one. Its furthest location from everything else as well.

{"instruction": "NO DUDE", "input": "", "output": "An injury to the muscle groups of the shoulder would impact total body function because it would result in limited movement in the upper body, meaning the arm cannot extend or flex at all, which impacts total body functon. This is because there are many functions and other joints/bones that are connected to the shoulder and if it is injured, the oither muscles that surround the shoulder such as the pectoralis major or latissimis dorsi have a harder time to complete its function, while also having to account for weaker deltoid muscles that most likely got injured with a shoulder injury. This puts more strain on ohter muslces and limits upper body movement as the shoulder typically is used for lateral movement in the arms, but with this injury, it has a harder time completing this task. This injury also impacts other parts of the body because the back for example, needs to \"put in\" more effort to maintain posture which poses more risk for more injuries to occur as the muscles in the back are working harder then it should."}

{"instruction": "OMG", "input": "", "output": "8. Beyond what has already been shared in your application, what do you believe makes you a strong candidate for admissions to the University of California? I awake to a mixture of aromas in the air. I smell the rich, flavorful spices of Indian food, but I also sense bitterness and stench of raw, uncooked meat. It is then that I realize that both my parents are cooking foods of their culture that could not be more different from one another. As a child of mixed background, I can empathize with others to create a friendly and efficient working environment. I am active in both cultures, which I hold a lot of pride in. Whether it be helping cook and serve food for over hundreds of people during Indian festivals or aiding in carnival games during the annual Vietnamese Moon festival , participating in both sides lets me connect with different people of opposite communities. Catching up with adults that I have not seen in a while and seeing little kids running around fills me with joy. Yet, I have witnessed the occasional stares when at these events since I do not necessarily fit in with the crowd. Nevertheless, I have been able to develop the ability of incorporating others so that no one is left out. In group projects, I make it a priority to get to know everyone and what they are like. In doing so, it helps to understand how people think to build the most productive and translucent work environment. Rather than assigning everyone individual parts that they must complete in a certain time frame, I make it known that everyone is free add to any part they wish, allowing them to play to their strengths. Overall, this builds team coordination and leaves everyone pleased with the group score that we earn. Being part of my communities has taught me valuable lessons that I apply daily. University of California has a reputation for having lively and unique communities. By assisting in enhancing the school\u2019s communities, both I and the school will grow together."}

{"instruction": "Unemployment: The percentage of the labor force that is currently not employed but actively seeking employment. Example: In February 2022, the unemployment rate in the United States was 4.2%. Labor force: The total number of people who are employed or unemployed but actively seeking employment. Example: The labor force in the United States in February 2022 was approximately 161 million people. Unemployment rate (calculation): The percentage of unemployed individuals in the labor force. The formula for calculating the unemployment rate is (Number of unemployed individuals / Labor force) x 100. Example: If the number of unemployed individuals is 5 million and the labor force is 150 million, the unemployment rate would be (5 million / 150 million) x 100 = 3.33%. Labor force participation rate (calculation): The percentage of the population that is in the labor force. The formula for calculating the labor force participation rate is (Labor force / Total population) x 100. Example: If the labor force is 150 million and the total population is 200 million, the labor force participation rate would be (150 million / 200 million) x 100 = 75%. Frictional unemployment: Unemployment that occurs when workers are temporarily between jobs or are searching for a better job. Example: A recent college graduate who is currently searching for a job would be considered frictionally unemployed. Seasonal unemployment: Unemployment that occurs due to seasonal changes in demand for labor. For example, a lifeguard who is only employed during the summer months. Example: A ski resort worker who is only employed during the winter season would be considered seasonally unemployed.", "input": "", "output": "k"}

{"instruction": "so stfu", "input": "", "output": "Moreover, possessing a strong work ethic along with having an innate talent is pivotal to success according to Gladwell\u2019s thesis. His argument states that 10,000 hours is the magical number of time a person needs to nurture their innate talent to succeed at a high level. Tyler Blevins, better known as Ninja online, applies to this theory as he has grown to become one of the most successful gamers: he has a net worth of 25 million dollars, played with celebrities such as Drake or Travis Scott, and has promoted the relevance of the gaming industry globally. As a child, his older brothers reported that he was already better than them at video games despite being a younger age. Beginning his professional career in 2009, Ninja would play Halo 3 until 2011 when he would first start streaming. For the past ten years, Ninja has streamed eight to twelve hours a day, five to six days a week playing a variety of video games rather it be professional or recreational. Calculating the amount of time he has put into keeping his audience entertained and practicing as a pro, Ninja has well surpassed the threshold of 10,000 hours. He displays how he not only has top-tier skill for a gamer, but has committed an enormous amount of time to becoming one of the best in his profession. Ninja was able to take his exceptional mechanical ability and improve upon that with thousands of hours of effort to rise to the pinnacle of the gaming business to support himself and his family. Had he put in any less time or doubted himself along the way, he would not be anywhere close to as successful as he is today."}

{"instruction": "From lowest to highest, surface tension ranked is pentane, decane, octanol, and lastly, water. Water has the most surface tension due to its positively charged hydrogens and negatively charged oxygens, resulting in its 2 hydrogen bonds being very strong. Octanol also has hydrogen bonds, but it contains carbon atoms that need to bond, reducing some of its surface tension. Decane is a bigger molecule compared to pentane, and therefore, will have more surface tension and stronger IMFs and LDFs. However, it does not contain any OH bonds, so its surface tension is less than octanol's. Decane has more carbon atoms than pentane will bond more, contributing to its greater strength.", "input": "", "output": "yeh where it has numebrs"}

{"instruction": "Hello Mrs. Potika, My name is Rohan Khatri and I am currently a second year Computer Science student. Attached is my current progress on the CSCI Science Electives and I was wondering if I took METR 10 next semester, I would complete the at \"at least 6 units coming from Special Science Electives Courses\" as I would have 7. However, for the required total 8 where \"the remaining units can come from GE Science courses (Areas B1, B2, or B3)\" I have AP credit from high school AP Physics that is equivalent to Physics 2A \"Fundamental Physics\" that completed my area B2 with 4 credits. My question is would those 4 credits that transferred from my AP credit be applicable to meet the remaining 1 credit left for the CSCI Science Electives after I take METR 10 next semester, or should I take a course that is 4 units in the CSCI Science Electives category?

{"instruction": "1. Describe an example of your leadership experience in which you have positively influenced others, helped resolve disputes or contributed to group efforts over time. From the second to the worst player, to becoming my tennis team\u2019s co-captain, the satisfaction from helping shape my peers into better versions of themselves on and off the court far outweighs my performance. It was the final game of the regular season that my team needed to clinch to advance to the playoffs. As I watched the games unfold, it came down to the 2 newer players needing to win. The opposing team was blatantly issuing unfair calls, but my teammates were powerless to do anything. This resulted in the last set tieing at 4-4, requiring a superset of first to score 11. As my teammates were flustered and angry, I could see the tension in the air, so I issued a timeout, beckoning them over. I dragged a bench over, stood on it, and as loudly as I could, I yelled; they snapped back to attention. I stressed that they ignore everything that had happened and focus on the next 11 points. Specifically, I instructed them not to stoop to our opponent\u2019s level and that we needed to win fairly. With our heads mushed together in a huddle, I began our team chant, prompting the rest of the team to join in: by the end, everyone was screaming with high spirits. One and a half hours later, we emerged victorious by three points. This game is just one of a multitude where I motivate my companions. As a leader, I remind the novices that I was once in their position as a subpar player and not to idolize me as some superstar player. I would rather that they view me as a fellow peer striving to improve than a superior bossing them around. I emphasize this idea whenever conducting practice drills centering on footwork or giving advice on the matchup brackets I help create with my coach that exploits the team\u2019s strengths.", "input": "", "output": "for the most part"}

During Covid, we made a server with 5-6 friends where we all go and hang out everyday because it is the only way we can socialize. Me and my friends have lately been making fun of Aaron for being a simp, because of how he treats girls so much better than us. And today, I went too far and I changed my discord status to what you saw. I honestly wanted to let you know that I have never had any connection to you, I haven't met you personally or even believe I have seen you before\u2026 and to be honest, I never knew Aaron actually had a current girlfriend. I didn't mean what I said, as I have never even been near you in my life, and what I said was a \u201cjoke\u201d to me and the friends in that discord. Aaron ended up telling me to change it, and I did, but an hour later he told me what happened. I am truly sorry that I upset you, as I can totally understand why you would be.. And I wanted to let you know that it was a terrible mistake for a poor \u201cjoke\u201d between our friends as it got out and for the short time I had that status, you saw it\u2026. I again, by no means meant what I said.. As I have never even met you in my life, and never knew Aaron even had a girlfriend. So\u2026 I am truly sorry, I have never had to apologize like this before, so I hope it came across as forgiving, And I hope that you can please forgive me, so that Aaron would still consider me a friend."}

Mercantilism was a system that saw any one country\u2019s wealth come at the expense of other countries.

Additionally, colonies would send more ships to their mother state/country, empowering the overall empire in wealth. 2. The mercantilist system required a union between the state and its merchants. Mercantilists benefitted both the monarch and merchant wealth. Thus, making European states richer, allowing for them to constantly wage almost unceasing wars against one another.

{"instruction": "like kaden", "input": "", "output": "My opinion on universal healthcare is that it is a valid concept that needs to be further developed to be supported throughout the nation so that all forms of healthcare are more available for people. Without a fully established universal healthcare system, a partial one has already done so much for society. In an article by Alex Rich and Andrew Walter, there is still a large number of uninsured Americans, but healthcare has helped reduce that amount. Universal health care needs to be a basic necessity for the people as a person\u2019s wealth should not affect their chances at continuing to live a long and healthy life. Despite this, I also understand why there are those who are against such an idea as it would lead to an increase in tax rates for tax payers and create a society that is more dependent on the federal government as depicted in the source. All in all, I think universal healthcare needs to be implemented, but the means of doing so needs to be reformed so that society is not greatly impacted."}

However, Frost\u2019s statement is not necessarily true as Malcolm Gladwell highlights in Outliers: The Story of Success how one\u2019s level of success is impacted by their access to opportunity as they not only need to master a skill set on a particular topic, but they must get lucky as well. To an extent, Gladwell\u2019s theory that success is obtained through a combination of circumstance and hard work holds true in today\u2019s society."}

{"instruction": "its a p", "input": "", "output": "\u201cLET!\u201d the opposition exclaims. As I prepare for my next service, I feel my heart pounding, ears ringing, and palms sweating. Tennis may seem a rather simplistic game: one hits a ball over a net back and forth with their opponent. However, competing as an individual no longer satisfied my desire for the game, but the thrill of battling alongside my teammates towards a team win further enhanced my passion for tennis. As my team\u2019s co-captain, the satisfaction from helping shape my peers into better versions of themselves both on and off the court far outweighs my performance. Being a team of 26, I turned this small group of shy kids presented before me who were completely alienated from one another into a small family that flourished in confidence over time. Many had never even touched a tennis racket before joining the team, but cheering during scrimmages and matches in addition to group video reviews of professional players allowed them to progress their skill tree. Repeating this course allowed for invaluable bonds to be built amongst ourselves, solidifying our team morale. Even though I was not the best on the team, staying after practice hours to play with others and answer questions while also helping fix their technique allowed both parties to grow as I became better at analyzing my opponent whereas my teammates were strengthening their foundation. Outside of strictly working with the team, I consulted with my head coach during the season to help create matchup brackets against other teams that accounted for our team\u2019s strengths and weaknesses. More importantly, I had prior years of experience playing the teams in our league, so I knew some of the players and how their playstyles, allowing me to offer crucial tips so that my teammates had an advantage. As I move on to the next chapter in my life, I am confident that my tenacity to aid those around me will be essential to my success."}

{"instruction": "gl on the next test", "input": "", "output": "Non-durable goods: Goods that have a lifespan of less than three years. For example, food or clothing. Nominal GDP vs. real GDP: Nominal GDP is the GDP that is not adjusted for inflation, while real GDP is the GDP that is adjusted for inflation. For example, if the nominal GDP is $10 trillion, but the inflation rate is 2%, the real GDP would be $9.8 trillion. Unemployment: The percentage of the labor force that is currently not employed but actively seeking employment. Labor force: The total number of people who are employed or unemployed but actively seeking employment. Unemployment rate (calculation): The percentage of unemployed individuals in the labor force. The formula for calculating the unemployment rate is (Number of unemployed individuals / Labor force) x 100. Labor force participation rate (calculation): The percentage of the population that is in the labor force. The formula for calculating the labor force participation rate is (Labor force / Total population) x 100. Frictional unemployment: Unemployment that occurs when workers are temporarily between jobs or are searching for a better job. Seasonal unemployment: Unemployment that occurs due to seasonal changes in demand for labor. For example, a ski resort worker who is only employed during the winter season. Structural unemployment: Unemployment that occurs due to a mismatch between the skills of job seekers and the available job openings. Cyclical unemployment: Unemployment that occurs due to fluctuations in the business cycle. For example, during a recession, many workers may be laid off."}

{"instruction": "However, some people adamantly argue that success is achievable as long as they have a passion for whatever they want to be successful in. Yet, passion is only one of the several key factors that lead to a person becoming successful at a high level; although having an intense interest is an important motivator for one to love what they do, that alone is not enough to thrive. Take French actor Arben Bajraktaraj for example. Notorious for his antagonist role in the Harry Potter films, Bajraktaraj has driven to become a well-known actor ever since he was a child. Despite this goal, Bajraktaraj has only ever starred in two films and has yet to be successful as an established actor in the entertainment industry. Unlike many famous actors such as Brad Pitt or Tom Cruise, Bajraktaraj has yet to experience the same opportunities that they went through that allowed them to be successful: that circumstance is the small chance that the film they are cast in does well and the actor plays a key role in making the plot enjoyable which will kick off their career. Bajraktaraj is unsuccessful in terms of being a top actor simply since he has not been able to have any good luck in the movies he acts in and no matter how much he enjoys his profession, that alone is unable to provide the luck he requires to become successful. Although still an actor, constantly acting in movies but not being recognized for his stagings can lead to Bajraktaraj becoming unmotivated over time and result in a decline in performance which further hinders his chances of becoming successful.", "input": "", "output": "and yeah"}

Angiotensin is a protein that is able to promote the secretion of aldosterone, which is a hormone that can raise blood pressure. This means the kidney can impact how much aldosterone is secreted by either releasing more renin to activate more angiotensin to release more aldosterone to raise blood pressure, or release less renin to release less aldosterone and have a lower blood pressure."}

{"instruction": "Moreover, possessing a strong work ethic along with having an innate talent is pivotal to success according to Gladwell\u2019s thesis. His argument states that 10,000 hours is the magical number of time a person needs to nurture their innate talent to succeed at a high level. Tyler Blevins, better known as Ninja online, applies to this theory as he has grown to become one of the most popular gamers having a net worth of 25 million dollars and the first professional player to be featured in an Entertainment and Sports Programming Network (ESPN) magazine cover. As a child, his older brothers reported that he was already better than them at video games despite being a younger age. Beginning his professional career in 2009, Ninja would play Halo 3 for multiple organizations until 2011 when he would first start streaming. For the past ten years, Ninja has streamed eight to twelve hours a day, five to six days a week playing a variety of video games rather it be professional or recreational. Calculating the amount of time he has put into keeping his audience entertained, Ninja has well surpassed the threshold of 10,000 hours and is arguably one of the most successful gamers of the decade: he has appeared in multiple commercials, played with celebrities such as Drake or Travis Scott, and has promoted the relevance of the gaming industry globally. Ninja displays how he not only had top-tier skill for a gamer, but has committed an enormous amount of time to becoming one of the best in his profession. Had he put in any less time or doubted himself along the way, he would not be anywhere close to as successful as he is today.", "input": "", "output": "i bascally did 2 things from thier conversation"}

{"instruction": "During internal respiration, oxygen gas goes through diffusion. The abundance oxygen gets transported from the blood capillary to the blood tissue via the hemoglobin that is contained in red blood cells. This will continue until equilibrium is achieved as oxygen gas moves from an area of high concentration, the blood capillaries, to an area of low concentration, the blood tissues. Gases move in this direction because equilibrium needs to be achieved so that the oxygen deficient cells can be converted into oxygenated cells so that the body can function. Contrastingly in internal respiration, the carbon dioxide rich cells that come from the pulmonary artery transport carbon dioxide gas into the alveolus. This is once again done in simple diffusion from high concentration of carbon dioxide in the capillaries which is achieved once the carbon dioxide leaves the blood cells to low concentration of carbon dioxide in the alveolus. This is to make sure carbon dioxide is not too concentrated in parts of the body as it is acidic and can be dangerous. This process is a form of passive transport.", "input": "", "output": "4v4?"}

{"instruction": "First and foremost, Gladwell\u2019s claim that a component to becoming successful depends on one\u2019s circumstances remains prevalent in the modern era. In today\u2019s society, people fail to attribute others\u2019 success to their circumstances that got them there in the first place, such as one\u2019s family background. One prime instance of this can be seen by Mark Zuckerberg who is Co-founder, CEO, and Chair of the billion dollar company Facebook. Growing up in New York in a wealthy family, Zuckerberg had access to opportunities kids his age at the time did not have. He focused on his education and had access to a computer which, according to his father, \u201c[Had] advantages being exposed to computers early on. That certainly enriched Mark\u2019s interest in technology.\u201d This ultimately resulted in him dropping out of Harvard University to pursue growing his company. If his family was never wealthy, Zuckerberg never would have been able to drop out of college and Facebook would be nowhere near as successful as it is today as it would likely not even be a company. Zuckerberg being born into a rich family was purely luck and that allowed him to develop a passion to follow a career in computer science. Had he been born into a less financially-stable family, he never would have had the opportunity to grow an interest in computers. Zuckerberg was able to take advantage of this circumstance that was thrust upon him and progress it into a successful business.", "input": "", "output": "that\u2019s not me"}

{"instruction": "like what?", "input": "", "output": "My head was pounding from the noise engulfing me. I marched forward with the snare drum weighing me down, mentally reminding myself to keep in time with the rest of the drumline around me. Recalling the numerous measures of notes, I had committed to memory, I carry out the rhythm, emphasizing specific beats. As I signal the drum break to command the band to a halt, the judge stand announces our score of 83. We were still in contention for a placement. It was the annual Franklin Invitational Band Review. Marching and jazz bands from all around California gathered to compete with one another in hopes of adding more trophies to their collections, further solidifying their prestige. Having performed towards the middle of the schedule, we earned a score placing us in the top 2 at the time, but we were not secured a placement as some of the top-ranking bands had yet to perform. Playing in an ensemble of so many people is no easy feat. It requires utmost precision, as just one note out of place can ruin the majestic melody. Whether it be competing against others or playing for an audience, music unites everyone. Coming into the tournament, we were confident as could be. Recovering from COVID-19, our band was majorly made up of underclassmen, essentially starting from scratch. All the evenings we had spent marching on the field, playing as sections, and talking about technique on Zoom video calls were going to pave the way to a placement. As we listened to the other bands perform, we grew more anxious. Yet, our confidence continued to persevere. However, our excitement was cut short at the announcement of the placements by the judges, where we realized that we did not earn a trophy, placing fifth out of the 38 attending bands."}

{"instruction": "ok", "input": "", "output": "Furthermore, another example of circumstance such as birth year impacting success can be seen in software engineer and co-founder of Youtube Jawed Karim. Born in 1979, he was able to graduate from Stanford University with a degree in Computer Science and create the platform Youtube with his colleagues. If Karim had been born a couple years earlier, he would have graduated from college too early to exploit the age of social media as he would have already secured a job at Paypal or found somewhere else with his degree. On the other hand, if he was born a few years later, he would have graduated from college too late and Youtube would have been developed too late since social media would have already overtaken the internet. Karim being born when he had was by complete chance and allowed him to release his platform in the early 2000s when social media and the internet were becoming more popular. Karim was fortunate enough to have been born when he was and he took advantage of that opportunity as he saw how creating a platform could lead to success. In essence, both Zuckerberg and Karim had luck-based opportunities handed to them which in correlation of putting in thousands hours of hard work led to them becoming successful which supports Gladwell\u2019s theory."}

{"instruction": "Thank you for the clarification. In the \"Minimum Wage\" episode of the TV show \"30 Days,\" Morgan Spurlock and Alex Jamieson agreed to live on minimum wage for 30 days to gain a better understanding of the challenges faced by minimum wage workers in the United States. They also set some self-imposed rules, such as not using their credit cards, not accepting help from family or friends, and not using any savings or other sources of income during the 30-day period. During the episode, Morgan and Alex did encounter some difficulties in following their self-imposed rules. For example, Morgan had to borrow money from a friend to pay for a medical emergency, and Alex accepted a gift card from her mother to buy groceries. However, they both made an effort to stick to their rules as much as possible and to live on the limited budget they had. So while they did break some of their rules, such as not accepting help from friends or family, they still made a genuine effort to live on minimum wage and experience the challenges faced by those who do so.", "input": "", "output": "where does it say pi/2 makes it cos"}

We were five points from receiving a trophy after a long drought of not placing for multiple years in a row. Yet, as we spent the next upcoming days reviewing our performance and reasons as to why we got penalized, we found solace in our shortcoming. 83 points was the highest score in our school history. We realized that even though we did not do as good as we had hoped, we still learned and gained much insight just by participating in the competition. We learned the true value was not just in the materialistic trophy, but the time we spent together working towards a common goal that each of us had a love for. At the contest, talking to other schools opened our eyes to how differently things are done and cheering for one another after a good execution was the true joy of the meet."}

I cant change ur ego and we cant change ours. ppl will just be passionate and be happy/mad/sad abt things they care abt and want to be good at. I will just have to put up with urs and urs with mine. After u left i realized theres no point in holding grudges or having drama, and that its just pointless and stupid/a waste of time. i saw in our last argument before u left, we tried to talk it out, but there was no point since both of us were pissed off and neither of us were trying to see each others pov. i dont speak for the others when i say this, but i would ask that we at least attempt to become friends again because before quarentine and all the drama of me and u arguing everyday for a straight month, we were actually really good friends in school. Maybe its because of DL, but i feel like we werent getting that same type of communication /connection then when were in person whether it be because u were never in the call or we were just always generally mad at each other. Im not trying to force u to be my friend or anything like that, just that u consider it and if u dont want to be because u think itll be too awkward or just wont be the same, i understand. I can try my best to change for what u want and u could do the same. on my side of the story, the reason i was always so mad at u was because i felt u always interacted with us the least, but if it was bc of ur schedule i get it.", "input": "", "output": "wait so u made it so that we have an edgeweighted parent class, then edgeweightedundigrpah for undirected and edgeweighteddigraph for directed and they both j reference it?"}

Rather than go through an uncomfortable icebreaker, simply talking to them about school and their hobbies offered an introspective view of what they were like. This helped build a productive and translucent work environment. Rather than assigning everyone their own part, I made it known that everyone was free to add to any part they wish, allowing them to play to their strengths.

{"instruction": "spent an hour and 20", "input": "", "output": "Q1. From the interface point of view, the method preferredLayoutSize() is intended to return the preferred size of the layout which is based on rules set by the layout. The size is affected by the components that are contained. This lets the container know how much size the layout needs to arrange the components and be displayed properly. For the layoutContainer() method, this method arranges the components in the container based on their specified sizes and positions. Where the components are placed and how big they are will be determined by the layout manager. The algorithm in the preferredLayoutSize() finds the total preferred width and height of the layout. The algorithm starts by getting an array of components that are children of the Parent container. There are left and right pointers with a height counter declared. The for loop iterates through the array of components 2 at a time since I+= 2, so it assumed the components are in pairs. Then, the left and right components' width and height are extracted, updating the left and right variables to the max width. Then the taller of the two components' heights are added to the height variable and the return statement returns the total preferred dimension with a GAP. ."}

{"instruction": "Thank you for the clarification. In the \"Minimum Wage\" episode of the TV show \"30 Days,\" Morgan Spurlock and Alex Jamieson agreed to live on minimum wage for 30 days to gain a better understanding of the challenges faced by minimum wage workers in the United States. They also set some self-imposed rules, such as not using their credit cards, not accepting help from family or friends, and not using any savings or other sources of income during the 30-day period. During the episode, Morgan and Alex did encounter some difficulties in following their self-imposed rules. For example, Morgan had to borrow money from a friend to pay for a medical emergency, and Alex accepted a gift card from her mother to buy groceries. However, they both made an effort to stick to their rules as much as possible and to live on the limited budget they had. So while they did break some of their rules, such as not accepting help from friends or family, they still made a genuine effort to live on minimum wage and experience the challenges faced by those who do so.", "input": "", "output": "he said iit would be nice but it wasnt required"}

{"instruction": "fat bitch", "input": "", "output": "6. I heard my doorbell ring. I opened the front door and discovered a package at my feet. My dad opened it and told me of the brand-new Amazon Alexa he had just purchased, informing me that it was a robot that could answer any of my questions. Hearing this as a 12-year-old, I was astonished by how a small device could accomplish such a feat as I basically had a computer in the palm of my hand. It was then that my interest in computer programming and artificial intelligence piqued, as it was a brand-new concept that had many possibilities. Creating remakes of popular games like Geometry Dash in the Scratch language in middle school helped develop my curiosity in the field and I could apply my math analysis skills. I grew tired of using the Scratch platform and would move onto learning HTML in my freshman year, further expanding my applications. Over the past summers, I have taken computer programming classes at CSU Sacramento where I participated in lectures that further built upon my fundamentals of programming. I was mainly taught in the use of pseudo code through \u201cbuilding blocks\u201d where I constructed programs that had real-life applications like probability of rolling a number on a die. I made a habit to stay and inquire my professor after each session to expand my knowledge. Pursuing computer science has already yielded benefits for me, specifically in my AP Physics I class in my junior year. For our final project, we had to construct a Rube Goldberg Machine which performs a series of energy conversions. I was able to apply what I knew about programming to the project via an Arduino as I programmed the device to conduct a multitude of steps that were vital to my group\u2019s success. This year, I am finally able to take AP Computer Science A where I will be learning about the Java programming language. Technology is ubiquitous, forever evolving and I want influence how it does so."}

Loop: A topspin shot where the racket grazes the ball, causing it to arc. Counter-hit: A counter to high-loop drives, using a closed racket for fast returns. Flip: A quick wrist action shot used close to the table. Smash: A powerful shot used when the ball bounces high or close to the net. Defensive Strokes Push (Slice): A backspin shot that slows the ball and makes it drop quickly. Chop: A heavier backspin shot used from a distance, creating a floating ball. Block: A return stroke that rebounds the opponent's shot back with equal force. Lob: A high defensive shot aimed to land on the opponent\u2019s side with spin."}

Although analysis can come in many forms, some of the various ways to analyze an author\u2019s work is through one\u2019s own memory and what they can remember from history, past life experiences, identifying symbols in the work, recognizing patterns, archetypes, and any routines characters may have.

In a goat for example when dealing with posterior and dorsal, the posterior is towards the back of them, meaning it is behind their tails. However, the dorsal side would be above the goat (vertically) as their vertebra is horizontal (parallel) to the ground. Contrastingly in humans, since they stand vertically and their vertebra is vertical (perpendicular) to the ground, both the posterior and dorsal side is towards the back of the human as it is towards the vertebra and back. The same difference can be seen in anterior and ventral terms. In a goat, the anterior side would be towards the front in front of their head, but the anterior side would be below them as their chest is under their body and horizontal to the ground. Compared to humans, the anterior and ventral side share the same side as humans stand vertically with their chests perpendicular to the ground. Therefore, these terms cannot always be used interchangeably."}

{"instruction": "\u201cLET!\u201d the opposition exclaims. As I prepare for my next service, I feel my heart pounding, ears ringing, and palms sweating. Tennis may seem a rather simplistic game: one hits a ball over a net back and forth with their opponent. However, competing as an individual no longer satisfied my desire for the game, but the thrill of battling alongside my teammates towards a team win further enhanced my passion for tennis. As my team\u2019s co-captain, the satisfaction from helping shape my peers into better versions of themselves both on and off the court far outweighs my performance. Being a team of 26, I turned this small group of shy kids presented before me who were completely alienated from one another into a small family that flourished in confidence over time. Many had never even touched a tennis racket before joining the team, so I began teaching them the various handle grips which eventually grew into more advanced shots. In addition, I led group video review sessions of professionals that allowed them to enhance their skill tree by learning how to take advantage of the court space. Repeating this course allowed for invaluable bonds to be built amongst ourselves, solidifying our team morale. Even though I was not the best on the team, staying after practice hours to play with others and answer questions while also helping fix their technique permitted both parties to grow as I became better at analyzing my opponent whereas my teammates were strengthening their fundamentals.", "input": "", "output": "alr"}

Going into senior year, I have made the decision that I want to major in Computer Science in college later in the future. Prior in February when course requests were available for this year, I selected Physics II not certain about my future but I have made that decision over the summer. Knowing what I want and after doing research with my parents and asking the advice of my teachers, I believe AP Statistics would be beneficial for me content wise and help cover credit for a Computer Science degree. It would be great if I could be switched out of Physics II for AP Stats since I believe it will help me more and the workload will be lighter in addition to my 2 other AP courses. Thanks, Rohan Kharti (99734652)"}

{"instruction": "and its only for like another week cuz he prob will after his test", "input": "", "output": "In Ray Bradbury\u2019s dystopian novel Fahrenheit 451, the protagonist Guy Montag lives in a society where firemen start fires, and the government requires the burning of books to discourage citizens from obtaining knowledge. After meeting his new neighbor Clarrise McClellan, Montag escapes the fake reality that he has been living in with the desire to change this rule but fails to make the people around him do the same, making him an outcast. Throughout the novel, Bradbury conveys that excessive reliance on technology weakens a society\u2019s ability to critically think as well as meaningfully interact with one another, leading to empty relationships, psychological starvation, and an absence of identity. Bradbury communicates this theme with the use of personification throughout the novel."}

{"instruction": "or shela", "input": "", "output": "Throughout the 16th century, the Safavid Empire remained a profoundly disturbing force in the Muslim world, dedicated to the defense and propagation Shi\u2019a doctrines at home and abroad. This policy implied a normal state of hostility with the Ottoman Empire, punctuated only briefly by periods of peace. By the 16th century, however, when the Safavid Empire reached its peak under Shah Abbas the Great (r. 1587-1629), the fanaticism of the Shi\u2019a revolution had faded, at least in the court circles; and a lasting peace with the Ottomans was concluded in 1639. William H. McNeill, The Rise of the West, 1963. Highlight or mark your best answer. Which would be the most useful source of evidence to support McNeill\u2019s contention that the Safavid Empire remained a profoundly disturbing force in the Muslim world? Writings by \u2026 a. Safavids about Shi\u2019a beliefs. b) Ottoman religious leaders of that time about the Safavids. c) modern-day Muslim historians. d) archaeologists that discovered Safavid and Ottoman relics. What brought an end to the \u201cnormal state of hostility\u201d between the Safavids and the Ottomans mentioned in the passage? a) The constant fighting increased the respect of the empires for each other, which eventually led to peace. b) Safavid fervor for its branch of Islam slowly declined until the two empires stopped fighting. c) Both sides united to fight against European Christian forces that threatened them. d) The Ottomans slowly gained greater power and were able to stop the agitation by the Safavids."}

In today\u2019s society, people fail to attribute others\u2019 success to their circumstances that got them there in the first place, such as one\u2019s family background. One prime instance of this can be seen by Mark Zuckerberg who is Co-founder, CEO, and Chair of the billion dollar company Facebook. Growing up in New York in a wealthy family, Zuckerberg had access to opportunities kids his age at the time did not have. He had a desire to learn growing up and had access to a computer which, according to his father, \u201c[Had] advantages being exposed to computers early on. That certainly enriched Mark\u2019s interest in technology.\u201d Had he been born into a less financially-stable family, he never would have had the opportunity to grow an interest in computers and drop out of Harvard University to pursue growing his company. Society fails to acknowledge that Zuckerberg being born into a rich family was purely luck, leading to the growth of a passion for computers that got him into a prestigious college and drop out, which all stemmed from his circumstances. If Zuckerberg did not come from a family that was supportive of him and was involved in his education, he never would have found Facebook or be anywhere near as successful as he is today. Zuckerberg was able to take advantage of this circumstance that was thrust upon him and progress it into a successful business.", "input": "", "output": "but like imma ask my parents to teach me stuff and see how i like it"}
